# 🤖 AWS Bedrock Training Labs

This repository contains hands-on training materials for learning AWS Bedrock, Amazon's fully managed service for building generative AI applications. 🚀

## 📂 Project Structure

### 🧪 `labs/`
This is your current working directory where you'll be implementing and experimenting with various AWS Bedrock features. Each lab focuses on a specific aspect of Bedrock:

- **🔌 API Integration**: Basic Bedrock API usage
- **📝 Text Generation**: Working with text models and prompts
- **🎨 Image Processing**: Image generation, understanding, and manipulation
- **⚡ Streaming**: Real-time response streaming
- **🔍 RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Building knowledge-based systems
- **🛠️ Tool Use**: Implementing function calling capabilities
- **💬 Chatbots**: Building conversational AI applications
- **🧠 Embeddings**: Vector search and semantic similarity
- **🛡️ Guardrails**: Content filtering and safety measures

### ✅ `completed/`
Contains the final, working implementations of all labs. Use these as reference solutions or to compare your work against the expected outcomes. Each folder mirrors the structure in `labs/` but with complete, tested code. 📋

### 📊 `data/`
Sample datasets, embeddings, and utility scripts for populating collections and testing your implementations.

### 🖼️ `sample_images/`
Image assets used in the image processing labs.

### ⚙️ `setup/`
Configuration and setup scripts for initializing your development environment.

## 🐍 Virtual Environment (.venv)

This project uses a Python virtual environment to ensure:

- **🔒 Dependency Isolation**: Keeps project dependencies separate from your system Python
- **📌 Version Control**: Ensures everyone uses the same package versions
- **🧹 Clean Development**: Prevents conflicts with other Python projects
- **🔄 Reproducibility**: Makes it easy to recreate the exact same environment

To activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **🔧 Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **📦 Install dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **🔑 Configure AWS credentials** with Bedrock access

4. **🎯 Start with the basic labs** in the `labs/` directory

5. **📚 Reference completed solutions** in the `completed/` directory when needed
